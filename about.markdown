*Placidia* is the hacker handle of *Catherine Dalzell*. In the real world, I am a Canadian statistician and data scientist from the East Coast. I post as *Placidia* on [Cross-Vaidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/14188/placidia), where I am among the top 2% of responders. 

How does one become a top 2% responder, you ask. It turns out that my best answers involved recycling old fashioned experimental design, probability theory and linear models for an audience that was approaching data analysis from other disciplines. *Cross-Validated* is full of amazing people from all sorts of backgrounds who find that they need to apply complex techniques to their data. They can run the software, but they don't know what it means. 

This is a nice problem to have. Back in the day, when I started my career, you were either a mathematical professional, or you operated numerically at about the level of a grade 8 student. That has changed. All those "boring" introductory stats courses, and the growth of analytical software, have created *citizen data scientists*, who are tackling some very impressive problems. Nevertheless, there is still a place for theory. When it comes to the analysis of data, there is always something new to learn.
