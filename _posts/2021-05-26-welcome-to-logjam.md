Welcome to LogJam, a data science blog about log files, data from IoT devices and other matters of interest. Typically, posts will fall into one of 3 categories, although I can't rule out the occasional rant on random topics.

* Analysing log files
* Non technical posts about the art and business of data science
* Technical posts about algorithms and data structures

### Why log files?

Data Science is a vast subject, and it's not getting any simpler as more use cases are found and more data sources are operationalized. I found that I had to take a stand and specialize on one particular type of problem. I've always preferred technical data -- that is, measurements of material processes -- as opposed to statistics applied to human behaviour. And it turns out that I have had several jobs where the use case involved log files from devices -- often large quantities of streaming log files.

I like the precise nature of logs. The information is limited in scope, semi-structured in presentation. I can wrap my head around that. Devices typically beg a number of obvious use cases:

* Can we use logs to monitor the devices?
* Can we detect when something has gone wrong?
* Can we detect when something is about to go wrong and take preventive action?
* Can we determine root causes when something has gone wrong?
* Can we use individual logs to say something about the system as a whole?

In addition, each situation will have questions of its own. There's lots to think about.

### Algorithms and data structures

This is a personal quest of mine. I have a statistics background rather than a computer science background, and I need to do some backfill. I'm particiularly interested in the algorithms that are used in all of the statistical software that I use. I like to know what's going on inside my black boxes.

### The rants

I've been around long enough to have formed a few opinions of what works and what does not work in statistics or data science. I would like to clarify my thinking by putting some words together on, what for lack of a better word, I will call paper.
